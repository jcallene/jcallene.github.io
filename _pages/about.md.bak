I am an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering Department at California Polytechnic State University. I recieved my PhD and MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.

<!--, where I worked with Rakesh Kumar in the PASSAT research group. -->


Research Interests: Fault Tolerant Systems, Scientific and High Performance Computing, Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, Low-power Design and Architectures.

<!-- My current research focuses on algorithmic techniques and architectures for tolerating and harnessing noise in stochastic systems, especially in the context of low energy processors. -->

`I am looking for ambitious and motivated graduate/undergraduate students. If you are a student looking for an advisor or if you are someone interested in applying to Cal Poly for studies, email jcallene@calpoly.edu if you want to do research in computer architecture, scientific and high performance computing, low power design, fault tolerance and/or CAD/architecture interactions. `
